        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>4 (4 ounce) beef top sirloin steaks</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, cut in half lengthwise</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Irish whiskey</li>
            <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil and butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat until butter has melted.</li>
            <li>Cook and stir onions in butter and oil until lightly golden brown, about 10 minutes. Push onions aside.</li>
            <li>Rub steaks with cut sides of garlic clove.</li>
            <li>Place steaks in the skillet, leaving the onions to the side, and cook over medium-high heat until meat<br>
            is browned but still lightly pink inside, 2 to 4 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Remove the skillet from heat. Slowly pour Irish whiskey into the hot skillet (be careful, whiskey fumes<br>
            are flammable).</li>
            <li>Mix browned onions into whiskey and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle steaks with salt, black pepper, and parsley.</li>
            <li>Turn steaks over in whiskey pan sauce to coat both sides, and drizzled with sauce.</li>
        </ol>
